  "question": "What is niraparib?",
  "answer": "Niraparib is a synthetic, orally administered small molecule that functions as a PARP (poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase) inhibitor. It inhibits normal DNA repair mechanisms and induces synthetic lethality in cells with homologous recombination defects, such as those with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. Niraparib has demonstrated antitumor activity in preclinical models of BRCA-mutant breast and pancreatic cancers, as well as in patient-derived ovarian and breast cancer xenograft models (NCT03840967).\n\nClinically, niraparib is used as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of advanced solid tumors, including platinum-sensitive, recurrent ovarian cancer (as studied in the Phase 3 NOVA trial, NCT03840967). It is administered orally, typically at a dose of 300 mg once daily, with dose adjustments based on patient weight and platelet count. Niraparib is supplied as capsules and should be swallowed whole.\n\nAdverse events associated with niraparib include myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), which are considered potential risks due to the drug\u2019s mechanism of action as a PARP inhibitor. However, in the NOVA study, the incidence of these events was similar between niraparib and placebo groups (NCT03840967).\n\nIn summary, niraparib is an oral PARP inhibitor used in the treatment of certain cancers, particularly those with homologous recombination deficiencies, and is being evaluated in multiple clinical trials for its efficacy and safety (NCT03840967).",
