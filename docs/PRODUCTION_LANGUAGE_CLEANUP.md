# Production Language Cleanup Summary

**Date:** January 2025  
**Purpose:** Remove production readiness claims from documentation to accurately reflect development status

## Problem Statement

The documentation contained language suggesting the system was "production-ready" or in "production" status, which could mislead users about the system's current maturity level. The system is in active development and should be clearly represented as such.

## Changes Made

### Documentation Files Updated

#### 1. Core Architecture Documents
- **`docs/SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md`**
  - Changed: `**Status:** Production` ‚Üí `**Status:** Active Development`
  - Rationale: System is actively being developed, not deployed in production environments

- **`docs/URETRIEVAL_ARCHITECTURE.md`**
  - Changed: `**Status:** Production` ‚Üí `**Status:** Active Development`
  - Rationale: U-Retrieval is functional but in development stage

- **`docs/README.md`**
  - Changed: `üìö Current Documentation (Production System)` ‚Üí `üìö Current Documentation`
  - Rationale: Removed production qualifier to avoid misrepresentation

#### 2. Feature Status Documents
- **`docs/QUERY_REWRITING_QUICKREF.md`**
  - Changed: `**Status**: ‚úÖ Tested and deployed` ‚Üí `**Status**: ‚úÖ Tested and functional`
  - Rationale: Feature works but "deployed" implies production deployment

#### 3. Status Reports
- **`docs/current_architecture_status.md`** ‚Üí **MOVED TO ARCHIVE**
  - File was marked DEPRECATED and redirected to SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md
  - Moved to: `docs/archive/current_architecture_status_DEPRECATED.md`
  - Rationale: File was already deprecated, contained wrong NCT count (18 vs 15), fabricated features, and production language

### Code Files Updated

#### 4. Scripts
- **`scripts/production_age_sync.py`**
  - Changed docstring: `Production-Ready AGE Property Graph Synchronization` ‚Üí `AGE Property Graph Synchronization`
  - Changed class docstring: `Production-ready AGE synchronization` ‚Üí `AGE synchronization with batch processing (development version)`
  - Changed success message: `Ready for production queries! üöÄ` ‚Üí `Graph synchronization complete! üöÄ`
  - Rationale: Script is functional but not production-hardened

## Files NOT Changed (Correctly Archived)

The following files contain production language but are in the `docs/archive/` directory and represent historical states:
- `docs/archive/Knowledge_Graph_Analysis_Report.md` - Contains "Phase 4: Production Readiness" and "Production Status" claims
- `docs/archive/current_architecture_status_BROKEN.md` - Contains "validate production readiness"
- `docs/archive/honest_performance_summary.md` - Contains "Production Reality" section
- `docs/archive/step4_implementation_complete_OBSOLETE.md` - Contains "System is ready for Step 5" language

**Rationale:** These archived documents represent historical planning or outdated analyses and are correctly marked as OBSOLETE or BROKEN. They serve as historical record and do not represent current system status.

## Language Guidelines

Going forward, prefer these terms:
- ‚úÖ "Active Development"
- ‚úÖ "Functional"
- ‚úÖ "Tested"
- ‚úÖ "Development version"
- ‚úÖ "Experimental"
- ‚úÖ "Research platform"

Avoid these terms unless factually accurate:
- ‚ùå "Production"
- ‚ùå "Production-ready"
- ‚ùå "Production-grade"
- ‚ùå "Deployed"
- ‚ùå "Enterprise-ready"
- ‚ùå "Commercial-grade"

## Verification

All production language has been removed from active documentation and code. The system is now accurately represented as:
- **Status:** Active Development
- **Current Use:** Research and development platform for clinical trial knowledge mining
- **Maturity:** Functional core features with ongoing development
