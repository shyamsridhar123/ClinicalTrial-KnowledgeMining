# Query Rewriting Quick Reference

## TL;DR

**Problem**: "What is niraparib?" → wrong answer (all chunks scored 0.663)  
**Solution**: Auto-expand to "Define niraparib. niraparib mechanism..."  
**Result**: Correct answer with proper ranking (scores 0.712, 2.224, etc.)

## When Does It Trigger?

### ✅ Rewritten
- `"What is niraparib?"` → Expanded
- `"What are PARP inhibitors?"` → Expanded  
- `"How does olaparib work?"` → Expanded

### ❌ Not Rewritten
- `"What is the relationship between X and Y?"` → Too complex
- `"What are adverse events with niraparib in Phase 2?"` → Specific enough
- `"What is niraparib and how is it administered?"` → Already detailed

## User Experience

### Before
```bash
$ pixi run -- python query_clinical_trials.py "What is niraparib?"

🔍 Query: What is niraparib?
Scores: 0.663, 0.663, 0.663 (all same!)
Answer: "Niraparib is described as a medication..." ❌ Incomplete
```

### After
```bash
$ pixi run -- python query_clinical_trials.py "What is niraparib?"

📝 Query expanded for better results:
   Original: 'What is niraparib?'
   Expanded: 'Define niraparib. niraparib mechanism...'
   
🔍 Query: Define niraparib. niraparib mechanism...
Scores: 0.712, 2.224, 2.224 (good variance!)
Answer: "Niraparib is a synthetic, orally administered 
         PARP inhibitor..." ✅ Complete & correct
```

## Quick Test

```bash
# Test rewriting
pixi run python -c "
from docintel.query import rewrite_query
print(rewrite_query('What is niraparib?'))
"

# Test with actual query
pixi run python query_clinical_trials.py "What is niraparib?"
```
