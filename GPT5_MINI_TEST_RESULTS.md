---

## API Compatibility Notes

### 🚨 Critical Differences from GPT-4.1:

1. **Parameter Names Changed:**
   ```python
   # GPT-4.1 (old)
   max_tokens=2000
   
   # GPT-5-mini (new)
   max_completion_tokens=2000
   ```

2. **Temperature Not Configurable:**
   ```python
   # GPT-4.1 (works)
   temperature=0.1
   
   # GPT-5-mini (ERROR)
   # temperature parameter not accepted
   # Fixed at default value (1.0)
   ```

3. **JSON Formatting:**
   ```python
   # GPT-4.1 (works)
   response_format={"type": "json_object"}  # Clean JSON
   
   # GPT-5-mini (inconsistent)
   response_format={"type": "json_object"}  # Sometimes returns text
   # Workaround: Request JSON in prompt + manual parsing
   ```

---

## Recommended Architecture

### **Option 1: Keep Both Models** ⭐ RECOMMENDED

```python
# Simple routing logic
def select_model(query: str, has_image: bool, requires_reasoning: bool):
    if has_image and requires_reasoning:
        return "gpt-5-mini"     # Complex visual analysis
    elif has_image:
        return "gpt-4.1"        # Simple image Q&A
    else:
        return "gpt-4.1"        # Text-only (cheaper, faster)
```

**Use Cases:**
- **BiomedCLIP:** Image search/retrieval (85% queries)
- **GPT-4.1:** Simple text Q&A, quick image analysis (10% queries)
- **GPT-5-mini:** Complex visual reasoning, long context (5% queries)

### **Option 2: Replace GPT-4.1 with GPT-5-mini**

**Pros:**
- Single model for all multimodal needs
- Better reasoning capabilities
- Larger context window

**Cons:**
- ❌ No temperature control (less deterministic)
- ❌ JSON output less reliable
- ❌ Cannot fine-tune responses as precisely
- ❌ Potentially higher cost for simple queries

**Verdict:** ⚠️ **Not recommended** - GPT-4.1 superior for simple text Q&A

## Cost Estimates

### Token Usage (Actual Test Results)

| Task | Prompt Tokens | Completion Tokens | Total |
|------|---------------|-------------------|-------|
| Basic Vision Analysis | 148 | 982 | 1,130 |
| Complex Reasoning | ~200 | ~2,000 | ~2,200 |

### Estimated Costs (based on GPT-4o-mini pricing)

Assuming GPT-5-mini priced similarly to GPT-4o-mini:
- Input: ~$0.15 per 1M tokens
- Output: ~$0.60 per 1M tokens

**Per-query cost:**
- Basic vision: ~$0.0006 ($0.60/1000 queries)
- Complex reasoning: ~$0.0013 ($1.30/1000 queries)

**Monthly estimates (conservative):**
- 50 visual queries/day × 30 days = 1,500 queries/month
- Cost: ~$0.90-2.00/month

**Verdict:** ✅ **Very affordable for your use case**

---

## Recommendations

### ✅ DO:

1. **Add GPT-5-mini for complex visual analysis**
   - Keep for queries requiring deep reasoning
   - Perfect for analyzing survival curves, flowcharts, complex tables
   - Use when context >100K tokens needed

2. **Keep GPT-4.1 for simple tasks**
   - Text-only Q&A
   - Quick image descriptions
   - Structured JSON output requirements

3. **Keep BiomedCLIP for search**
   - Image retrieval (already works perfectly)
   - Fast, specialized, cost-effective

4. **Implement simple routing logic**
   - Decision tree based on query characteristics
   - Log routing decisions for audit trail

### ✅ CONSIDER:

1. **Evaluate replacing GPT-4.1 with GPT-5-mini**
   - GPT-5-mini likely cheaper (follows GPT-4o-mini pricing pattern)
   - Fixed temperature is by design (optimized for reasoning)
   - JSON workaround is simple and reliable
   - Larger context window (400K vs 1M)
   - Better reasoning capabilities
   - **Recommendation:** Test in production, likely superior overall

2. **Don't use Azure model-router**
   - Your use cases are well-defined
   - Simple logic sufficient
   - No need for black-box routing

3. **Don't expect fine-grained control**
   - GPT-5-mini temperature is fixed
   - Reasoning mode behavior is non-deterministic
   - Accept trade-off: power vs. precision

## Implementation Code

### Working GPT-5-mini Vision Analysis

```python
from openai import AzureOpenAI
import base64

client = AzureOpenAI(
    api_key=os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY"),
    azure_endpoint=os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT"),
    api_version="2024-12-01-preview"
)

def analyze_figure_with_gpt5mini(image_path: str, question: str) -> str:
    """Analyze medical figure using GPT-5-mini with reasoning."""
    
    # Encode image
    with open(image_path, "rb") as img:
        base64_image = base64.b64encode(img.read()).decode()
    
    # Call GPT-5-mini
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-5-mini",
        messages=[
            {
                "role": "system",
                "content": "You are a clinical trial analyst. Provide detailed, step-by-step analysis."
            },
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": [
                    {"type": "text", "text": question},
                    {
                        "type": "image_url",
                        "image_url": {
                            "url": f"data:image/png;base64,{base64_image}"
                        }
                    }
                ]
            }
        ],
        max_completion_tokens=3000  # Note: max_completion_tokens, not max_tokens!
        # Note: No temperature parameter (not supported)
    )
    
    return response.choices[0].message.content
```

### Workaround for JSON Output

```python
def get_structured_analysis(image_path: str) -> dict:
    """Get structured JSON output from GPT-5-mini (with workaround)."""
    
    question = """Analyze this figure and return ONLY valid JSON with this structure:
    {
      "figure_type": "...",
      "key_findings": ["...", "..."],
      "numerical_values": {"...": ...},
      "clinical_significance": "..."
    }
    Return ONLY the JSON object, no additional text."""
    
    response_text = analyze_figure_with_gpt5mini(image_path, question)
    
    # Extract JSON from response (handles cases where model adds explanation)
    import json
    import re
    
    # Try to find JSON block
    json_match = re.search(r'\{.*\}', response_text, re.DOTALL)
    if json_match:
        return json.loads(json_match.group())
    
    # Fallback: parse entire response
    return json.loads(response_text)
```
